# Music store analysis SQL project

* Overview:
This project explores a music store database using SQL. It includes a variety of queries designed to extract useful business insights, ranging from basic filtering and aggregations to more complex customer, employee, and genre-based analysis. The dataset mimics real-world scenarios and is ideal for practicing data analysis with SQL, especially in PostgreSQL.

* Project Objectives:
Analyze sales and customer data

Identify best-performing cities, customers, and employees

Understand music trends by genre, artist, and location

Write clean, well-structured SQL for data reporting

* Topics Covered
Data filtering and sorting using WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT

Aggregations using SUM, AVG, COUNT

Joining multiple tables to combine data

Grouping and summarizing using GROUP BY

Window functions like ROW_NUMBER()

Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Type casting and conditional logic using CASE

* How to Use
Clone the repository or download the SQL file.

Connect to your PostgreSQL database (or any compatible SQL tool).

Run the queries step-by-step.

Modify as needed for your learning or projects.
